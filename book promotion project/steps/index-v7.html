    PathWave Signal Generation has two kinds of applications as Desktop or Embedded. PathWave Signal Generation Desktop is running in the PC like Signal Studio, which can create and download generated waveforms into various signal generators. PathWave Signal Generation Embedded is fully integrated application in Keysight VXG signal generatorâ€™s firmware. PathWave Signal Generation Embedded shares same measurement technology as PathWave Signal Generation Desktop while its GUI is optimized for touch-based operations.
